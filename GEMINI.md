# Gemini CLI - SaaS Solution for Catering Restaurants

## Project Topic
**SaaS solution for restaurants offering catering services.**

## Project Description
A web-based platform connecting small restaurants with their end customers (catering recipients). The platform will enable precise personalization of diet configurations and delivery schedules (e.g., specific weekdays, date ranges). Processes such as **order tracking**, **automated payments**, and **delivery management** will be streamlined.

### Key Features:
- **Diet & Delivery Customization**
    - Personalized meal plans based on dietary preferences.
    - Flexible scheduling (e.g., recurring orders, one-time deliveries).
- **Order & Payment Automation**
    - Real-time order tracking for customers.
    - Automated invoicing and payment processing for restaurants.
- **Analytics & Reporting**
    - Sales statistics and user activity dashboards.
    - Admin-generated reports (sales, customer engagement).
    - Data export to CSV for further analysis.
- **Multi-Tenant SaaS Model**
    - **B2B (Restaurants):** Subscription-based access with admin tools.
    - **B2C (Customers):** User-friendly interface for ordering and tracking.

### Problem Solved
- **For Restaurants:** Reduces administrative overhead by automating orders, payments, and logistics.
- **For Customers:** Simplifies meal personalization and order tracking, saving time for both parties.

### Technical Scope
- Backend - Symfony API, frontend - Flutter.
- Secure payment gateway integration (Stripe).
- Role-based access control (admins, restaurants, customers).
- Data visualization (charts, exportable reports).
